  goals: 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the different loop structures (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code>)
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code> loops
    - To be able to apply iteration and conditionals to a <code>String</code>
