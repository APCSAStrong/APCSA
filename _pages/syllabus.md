  course_title: "AP Computer Science A"
  course_homepage: "https://www.billmongan.com/APCSA/"
  course_prerequisites: "No prior programming experience is assumed! People from all backgrounds with all levels of experience are welcome. As long as you have a laptop that was manufactured within the past 10 years, you will be able to do all of the assignments and participate in class."
  course_description: "Introduction to the field of computer science. Topics include: methods for computational problem solving, algorithm development techniques, processes for development of new technologies, and programming projects of increasing complexity in a high-level language with emphasis on good programming style. The course also includes exposure to advanced topics in computer science such as graphics, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. Recommended for students in mathematics; business and economics; and the natural sciences. No prior computer programming experience is assumed. Offered every semester. Three hours of lecture and one hour of laboratory per week."
  welcome_message: "Welcome to APCSA!  In this course, we will explore together the ways in which computing positively affects our lives and helps us to understand and to interact with the world around us.  We will learn to automate powerful functionality through the use of programming fundamentals.  We will connect these fundamentals to underlying theory of Mathematics and Computer Science, and learn to apply that theory for good."
  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 11:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  No prior permission is required for flexible submission, which allows up to 2 days to be used during the semester by each student.  For example, one deliverable may be submitted 2 days late, or two deliverables may each be submitted 1 day late.  After these 2 days are utilized, subsequent deliverables may be submitted after the deadline, awarding up to: 95% credit for work submitted up to 6 hours past the deadline, 90% credit for work submitted up to 24 hours past the deadline, 80% credit for work submitted up to 48 hours past the deadline, and 50% credit for work submitted up to 7 days past the deadline.  To exercise flexible submission, please e-mail the instructor after submitting your deliverable, indicating: a) which deliverable you have submitted past the deadline, and b) how many flex days you wish to use (if any)."
