      questions: 
        - What happens if you print an escape character?  Does the backslash actually print?
        - Why do you think we call these &quot;escape characters?&quot;
        - What escape character do you think prints a backslash to the screen?
        - How would you print the actual characters <code>\\n</code> to the screen (i.e., not a newline character, but the actual backslash and n characters)?
